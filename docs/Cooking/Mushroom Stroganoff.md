## Directions:
- **Cook Noodles**: Cook noodles in boiling, with salted water
- **Saute Mushrooms**: Melt butter in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add onions and saute for 5 minutes. Add garlic and stir to combine. Continue cooking for an additional 5-7 minutes, until the mushrooms are cooked and tender. Add the white wine, and deglaze the pan. Let the sauce simmer for 3 minutes.
- **Thicken**: Meanwhile, in a separate bowl, whisk together the vegetable stock, Worcestershire and flour until smooth. Pour the vegetable stock mixture into the pan, along with the thyme, and stir to combine. Let the mixture simmer for an additional 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until slightly thickened. Then, stir in the Greek yogurt.
- **Serve**: Plate over the noodles and garnish.
