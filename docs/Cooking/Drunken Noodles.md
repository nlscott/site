I got addicted to Thai food living in the DC area. After moving to a small town in rural Ohio, I had to figure out how to make it myself.
<br>

## Notes:

`Soy Sauce` - any store bought works. I prefer monggo sun which is super niche Koren soy sauce that a friend got me hooked on. You won't find this unless you have a Koren grocery store near by.

`Oyster Sauce and Fish Sauce` - these can be found in most main stream grocery stores any more. Look down the ethnic food aisle.

`Shaoxing Wine and Golden Mountain Sauce` - admittedly niche and most people probably don't have these on hand. The dish is still great without them and I've made that way many times. But if you live near an Asian grocery store, it's worth the purchase. 

<br>

## Directions:
- **Cook Noodles**: Boil water and cook rice noodles 3 to 5 minutes. 
  - Put in colander and wash with cold water. Separate noodles with fingers to remove starch.

- **Make Sauce**:  Combine soy sauce, chili garlic sauce ,oyster sauce, brown sugar, minced garlic, fish sauce,  shaoxing wine, and golden mountain sauce in a small glass. Stir. Set aside.
- **Cook vegetables**: Heat oil to medium high in a  pan and sauté vegetables. 
  - Push vegetables to the side and add scrambled egg until set. Remove from pan.

- **Cook Chicken**: Add Chicken to pan and cook for  about 3-5 minutes.
- **Add Noodles**: Add rice noodles and sauce on top of chicken. Toss to combine for about 3 to 5 minutes.
- **Add Vegetables**: Add vegetables back to pan and cook until hot.
- **Garnish**: If adding tomatoes wait until the last 60 seconds and add to pan. Remove from heat when tomatoes are hot. If adding Green onions, wait until you've removed from heat and plated the dish.

> **Vegetarian**: I've made this vegetarian, a thousand times due to a non-meat eater and it's just as good. You can subsitute mushroom sauce for oyster sauce, omit the fish sauce and replace chicken with tofu, or just add more eggs for protein.
