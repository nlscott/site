# Chicken Tiki Masala
<br>

I will admit, I don't usually marinate my chciken ahead of time and often cheat with precooked chicken. It's worth the extra time to marinate and theres plenty of recipes out that with steps. Ocassionaly I do marinate in yogurt and put it on a charcoal grill and it is amazing!

But this is a fairly easy weeknight dinner if you want to just skip the marinating.

Butter: 2-3 tbsp
Onion: 1 medium (diced)
Garlic: 3 cloves (minced)
Ginger: 2 tbsp (minced)
Tomateo Sauce: 14 oz can
Spices:
  Garam Masala: 1 tbsp
  Ground Coriander: 2 tsp
  Smoked Paprika: 2 tsp
  Cumin: 1 tsp
  Turmeric: 1 tsp
  Chili Powder: 1 tsp
  Salt: 1 tsp
Heavy Cream: 1 cup (optional Whole Milk)
Water: 1/4 cup (if needed)
Optional:
  Chicken Stock: 1 cup
  Fenugreek: 1 tbsp
  Kashmiri Chili Powder: 1 tbsp
```


<br>
## Notes:
Make with rice and homemade [Naan](https://rasamalaysia.com/naan/) (Or Trader Joes frozen naan is pretty great too)

`Fenugreek and Kashmiri Chili` are not easy to find, unless you have an Indian grocery store. It turns out great without them.

> **Vegetarian**: I've made this vegetarian by switching the chicken for chickpeas, probably more times then acutally using chicken. The spice and flavor is just at good and I personally don't miss the chicken.
